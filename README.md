# Nonna's Cookbook

A simple cookbook of traditional italian recipes was an opportunity to practice first-hand:
- Building a Single Page Application using React
- Implementing static and dynamic React routing
- Building an API using PostgreSQL and ElephantsSQL
- Fetching, displaying and updating data from the API
- Using ReactHooks (useState, useEffect, useNavigate, useRef)
- Implementing a searchbar
- Building a form including text and media with Multer to post new recipes to the database
